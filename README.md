# To-Do-List
 My personal To-Do-List
I created this program to practice the basics of html, css, and javascript. All this program does is create a to-do-list, where you can add and delete different task and keep track of things you do.

**Set up**: Download this zip file and open it in a file editor (preferably VSCode) and download the live server extension. Then go to index.html and run from live server.
